This section deals with my works on address parsing. And it demonstrates how I have worked with messy datasets.

In record linkage, the status of a pair of records is either matching (same individual) or non-matching (distinct individuals). This process consists in three successive steps: data preprocessing (curation of the data), record pair comparison and linkage.

In these files, I have worked more with the first two steps of the record linkage, i.e., the data preprocessing anf record pair comparisons. I used different string matching to check for similar or duplicates across the individual data input. I have worked with raw data of organizations and their details, which were open-source and collected from various verified online data providers, but the information in all of them were not standardized. One of the hurdles faced in this work was to standardize the inputs, so as to reduce duplicates.
